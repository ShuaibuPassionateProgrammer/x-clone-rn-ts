# X Clone (React & TypeScript)

This project is a modern web application built to replicate the core functionality and design of **X** (e.g., Twitter). It leverages **React** with **TypeScript** to provide a dynamic, type-safe, and scalable solution. The application showcases various web development concepts, including state management, real-time updates, and responsive design.

It serves as an excellent hands-on learning experience for building complex web apps with React and TypeScript, while maintaining a focus on clean, maintainable code.

## Key Features:
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and user session management.
- **Real-time Updates**: Live updates for tweets, likes, comments, and notifications.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Strict type-checking and enhanced developer experience with TypeScript.
- **State Management**: Efficient state management for seamless UI interactions.

## Tools and Technologies:
- **React** for component-based UI development.
- **TypeScript** for type safety and improved code maintainability.
- **CSS/SCSS** for styling.
- **Firebase** (or any other backend, depending on your setup) for user authentication and real-time data sync.

This project demonstrates best practices in modern web development and is perfect for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of React and TypeScript.
